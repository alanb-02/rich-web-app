# Module Work Repo

The content for lab-1 is in worksheet1. Within the folder, there are three other folders for each of the problems:
- The first problem is to do with the responsive grid that reacts to the screen size.
- The second problem is to create a note taking app that can create notes, view them, delete, and also change the background colour on them. To change the color you will have to click the 'edit/save' button first.
- The third problem was to make some changes to the files provided, that in turn creates a chrome extension that will change images, text and play audios. In my case I have changes the images on the webpages to coronavirus memes, I have turn certain headings adn text to corona warnings, and finally I have added an audio any time you click a <p> element.
